# Einstein for Visual Studio Code

Upload lab task files directly to Einstein for your module from within Visual Studio Code and instantly get results back with detailed information on failed tests.

### 🔧 Installation

You can download the Extension here: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Hamzah.vscode-dcu-einstein>

### 👤 Motivation

Opening and using the Einstein interface in the browser can be slow for workflow, especially on one monitor. Constantly changing window to select and upload your task from your system, seeing results, and going back into VS Code to modify them really slowed me down. Receiving a response back for each individual test also allows me to refactor my code as needed and re-upload quickly.
